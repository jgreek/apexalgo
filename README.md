# ApexAlgo

Welcome to **ApexAlgo**! This repository is a testament to my daily journey through the fascinating world of algorithms
and data structures. As I make my way through various algorithmic challenges, I've designed this space to track my
progress, approaches, and solutions in a structured manner.

## 🎯 Project Description

Every day, I delve deep into a new problem or refine my approach to an old one. ApexAlgo is more than just a collection
of algorithmic solutions. It's:

- A pursuit of **efficiency** and **elegance** and taking joy in the act of solving problems.
- A canvas for **creativity**, where every algorithm is an artwork in code.
- A bridge to **connect** with other passionate problem solvers.
- A personal journal to **reflect**, **revisit**, and **refine** my methodologies.

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Language**: Python

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

To run any solution:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the solution.
2. Execute the file using Python, ensuring the `if __name__ == "__main__":` condition is present in the file.

   Example:

```python3 filename.py```

## 🤝 Contributions
